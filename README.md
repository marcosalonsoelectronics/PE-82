Material of video PE-82:  Quasi-Resonant Flyback Converter

Available at: https://youtu.be/G4soMMpuDhE

This video explains the operation of the quasi-resonant (QR) flyback converter. The operation of the converter during the off state is analyzed in detail to obtain the voltage across the switch. The output voltage and switching frequency in QR mode are also calculated. An example of simulation is Qspice is also shown.
